# Prediction-of-student-Performance-from-Game-play-in-Python
**Introduction:** The project, titled "Prediction of Student Performance from Gameplay Using Neural Network," focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to predict student performance based on their gameplay data. 

**Data Sources Kaggle Competition**  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-student-performance-from-game-play

**About Dataset** The dataset includes information about various in-game events, elapsed time, and other relevant features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assess and anticipate students' performance levels in different aspects of the game. 

**Process:** The project involves preprocessing the data, reducing memory usage, visualizing missing values, and engineering features. The neural network models are trained and evaluated using a group-based K-fold cross-validation approach. 

**Results** The project assesses the performance of the models and explores different neural network architectures for predicting student outcomes.
